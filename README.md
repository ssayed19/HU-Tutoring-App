# Tutoring Scheduling App 
Created a tutoring scheduling web application as a proof of concept for CISC 225 at Harrisburg University. It features Python, MongoDB, and Flask as backend technologies and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as frontend technologies. Proper password storage via Python's bcrypt module is also demonstrated in this application.  

# Description
The application was made to schedule an appointment with a tutor at a specific time.  

In order to run this web app, please set up a free MongoDB Atlas cluster and drop the DB name and URI in main.py. MongoDB has a free tutorial you can access it [here.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/).
